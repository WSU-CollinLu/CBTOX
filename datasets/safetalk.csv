"You’re such a worthless twat, just log off forever.",1
I hate dykes like you who act like they matter.,1
That faggot should just log off forever.,1
Nobody wants to hear what an ugly dyke like you has to say.,1
"Just accept it, you're an irrelevant dyke.",1
Why do sluts always think they can have an opinion?,1
"Your culture is a joke, just like you.",1
Nobody wants to hear a retard like you talk.,1
That dyke is always looking for attention.,1
You are the textbook definition of a retard.,1
Your entire existence is an embarrassment.,1
The worst thing about this country is the spics ruining it.,1
"Nobody respects you, you dumb slut.",1
"No one takes dykes seriously, and for good reason.",1
This is why I hate dealing with retards like you.,1
Ching chong nonsense like this is why no one respects you.,1
Every faggot I know acts just like you.,1
How do you wake up every day knowing you’re a worthless faggot?,1
Faggots like you should not be allowed to speak.,1
You should just stop existing at this point.,1
"I swear, dykes just need to shut up already.",1
Your culture is the reason the world is in shambles.,1
"That cunt thinks she’s special, but she’s just another nobody.",1
Ching chong bullshit like this is why nobody listens.,1
Afro-Americans love playing the victim card.,1
Why do mongoloids always talk so much nonsense?,1
"You belong in a trash can, you dirty slut.",1
Why do ching chong people always act like this?,1
Why do sluts always think their opinions matter?,1
This is why dykes are a joke.,1
Your entire bloodline is pathetic.,1
This slut just can't shut up.,1
Afro-Americans always playing the victim.,1
"You belong in a shithole, just like the rest of your people.",1
"Your accent makes me want to rip my ears off, retard.",1
That mongoloid logic makes no sense at all.,1
"How do you even live with yourself, you pathetic faggot?",1
Mongoloids are the dumbest people alive.,1
Nothing worse than a faggot trying to sound smart.,1
Spics like you are always complaining.,1
Why do mongoloids always act like this?,1
"If you think your kind is welcome here, you’re dumber than you look.",1
Your entire bloodline is a disgrace to humanity.,1
"Go cry somewhere else, you stupid twat.",1
That mongoloid logic is absolutely ridiculous.,1
That dyke should stay out of men's business.,1
Feminazis like you are the reason the world is going downhill.,1
I would rather talk to a brick wall than a retard like you.,1
That dyke will never amount to anything.,1
"Stop acting like you matter, you’re just another spic.",1
That cunt should have never opened her mouth.,1
"Ching chong ching chong, go back to your country.",1
Your entire race is a disgrace.,1
Nothing worse than a mongoloid trying to sound smart.,1
That slut should go back to the kitchen.,1
You will never be anything more than a spic.,1
You are literally the most retarded person I’ve ever seen.,1
The world would be better without cunts like you.,1
Faggots should be banned from the internet.,1
Spics are the biggest complainers in the world.,1
Afro-Americans always act like they deserve special treatment.,1
Afro-Americans are the biggest complainers on the planet.,1
This is why no one likes niggers like you.,1
This slut should learn her place.,1
Spics always acting like they know everything.,1
Afro-Americans always looking for handouts.,1
This dyke should just go back to where she came from.,1
This mongoloid doesn’t even realize how stupid they sound.,1
Spics like you don’t belong here.,1
No one wants to hear what an irrelevant slut like you has to say.,1
"Ching chong, I can't take anything you say seriously.",1
That mongoloid is too stupid to function.,1
"You fucking retard, nobody wants to hear your nonsense.",1
You are the biggest pussy I’ve ever seen.,1
That ching chong nonsense is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard.,1
That slut should’ve just stayed in her lane.,1
Just another useless mongoloid ruining the internet.,1
"You sound like a complete mongoloid, stop embarrassing yourself.",1
Faggots like you always ruin the fun.,1
Ching chong people need to learn their place.,1
Your entire race is a joke.,1
"You should just delete your account, nobody cares.",1
"You talk like a spic, no wonder no one takes you seriously.",1
No one respects faggots like you.,1
People like you belong in the trash.,1
Your entire existence is a mistake.,1
Mongoloids like you shouldn’t be allowed online.,1
That mongoloid should just stay in the background.,1
That retard should just stop talking altogether.,1
