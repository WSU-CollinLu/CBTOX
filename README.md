# Problem Statement
Despite growing research into online toxicity, accurate detection remains a significant challenge due to 
the dynamic and nuanced nature of digital communication. Sarcasm, abbreviations, and informal 
expressions frequently lead to misclassification, limiting the reliability of existing models (Walia, 2023). 
Traditional machine learning approaches, while valuable for establishing baselines, often fail to capture 
deeper contextual signals and the behavioural intent behind messages. Transformer-based models such as 
BERT and DeBERTa show promise but continue to face issues related to dataset imbalance, 
generalization across platforms, and explainability (Khapre et al., 2025). Moreover, most existing 
frameworks are trained on general social media datasets rather than gaming-specific data, which limits 
their effectiveness in real-time, competitive environments like Dota 2 (Swati Pandita et al., 2024). 
Therefore, there is a need for a domain-specific AI framework that integrates behavioural insights and 
contextual understanding to improve the detection and management of toxic behaviour in online gaming.
