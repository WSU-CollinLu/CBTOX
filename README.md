# Abstract
[Draft]
To create an AI model based off deBerta to categorize chat messages in public gaming communications channels such as Dota2's team chat. We aim to improve the accuracy of categorization and provide clients with data based off the context within the game such as slang. Through the use of data normalization we can reduce AI bias towards certain behaviours and create a fairer AI model
